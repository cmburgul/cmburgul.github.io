title: Within Hand Manipulation Planning using Reinforcement Learning Technique
date: 2019-01-30 13:32:20 +0300
description: Within Hand Manipulation(WIHM) is seen as a good skill in Robotic Manipulation tasks which reduces manipulation complexity in scenarios where object to be manipulated needs to be re-oriented or re-positioned to perform a given task. This project explores a model-free approach for planning of WIHM tasks using Reinforcement Learning Techniques.

Within Hand Manipulation(WIHM) is seen as a good skill in Robotic Manipulation tasks which reduces manipulation complexity in scenarios where object to be manipulated needs to be re-oriented or re-positioned to perform a given task. The WIHM system involves multiple Degrees of Freedom, multiple points of contact and varying friction forces. This makes the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the system a complex task. Inaccurate mathematical model of the system will not suffice for accurately planning a trajectory using conventional control system. Hence, This project explores a model-free approach for planning of WIHM tasks.
